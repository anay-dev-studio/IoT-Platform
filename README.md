# IoT-Platform
This is device provision platfrom capable of provision edge devices, leaf devices. It has also device twin manager, which offers to update device twin. Module manager helps to update modules for edge devices. Our target is create resillient, optimized code able to connect multiple cloud environment.
IoT Platform targets devices are leaf devices, which are not able to connect to IoT platforms directly. For that we are using edge devices. Edge devices are available in factory premises and it has device modules. Device modules are capable to conncet with leaf devices. So, leaf device can send data to our edge device and edge device can register them as a IoT devices and send data to cloud. 
Protocol Translation using Edge Devices: Lets say we have Opc-UA devices, which are not able to connect with cloud directly. Now, we have edge device as a protocol translator, where we have modules for the leaf devices. Modules are client, which able to recive data from leaf device and once data got received in edge module, edge device transfer that data to cloud.
